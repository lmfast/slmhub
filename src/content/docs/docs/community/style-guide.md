## Headings

- Use descriptive H2/H3s.
- Keep sections short and scannable.

## Formatting

- Prefer lists over long paragraphs.
- Use inline code for identifiers: `HF_TOKEN`, `vLLM`, `model_id`.
- Link internally using relative paths (GitBook-friendly).

## Terminology

- “SLM” = small language model (use-case definition).
- “Model revision” = specific commit hash or revision pin.
- “Acceptance prompts” = your workload-representative eval set.
