Essential tools and libraries for working with SLMs. Guide: [Model Picker](/slmhub/docs/tools/model-picker).

## 1. Library Checker
Check which essential SLM libraries are installed in your environment.

```python
import importlib

libraries = [
    "transformers", "torch", "peft", "trl", 
    "datasets", "accelerate", "bitsandbytes", 
    "sentence_transformers", "chromadb", "vllm"
]

print(f"{'Library':<25} {'Status':<10} {'Version'}")
print("-" * 45)

for lib in libraries:
    try:
        module = importlib.import_module(lib)
        version = getattr(module, "__version__", "installed")
        print(f"{lib:<25} {'✅':<10} {version}")
    except ImportError:
        print(f"{lib:<25} {'❌':<10} Not Found")

print("\nTo install missing: !pip install <library_name>")
```

## 2. Speed Test: Embedding Models
Quickly benchmark commonly used embedding models.

```python
!pip install sentence-transformers
```

```python
import time
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

models_to_test = [
    "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",      # Ultra fast
    "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" # High quality small
]

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." * 100

for m_name in models_to_test:
    print(f"Loading {m_name}...")
    model = SentenceTransformer(m_name)
    
    start = time.time()
    emb = model.encode([text] * 10)
    end = time.time()
    
    print(f" -> Time for 10 docs: {end-start:.4f}s\n")
```
