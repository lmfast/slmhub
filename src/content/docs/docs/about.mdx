# About SLM Hub

**SLM Hub** is a developer-first platform dedicated to the explosion of **Small Language Models (SLMs)**.

## Our Mission

To democratize AI by proving you don't need a massive GPU cluster to build powerful, intelligent applications. We believe the future of AI is **local, private, and efficient**.

## The Team

SLM Hub is maintained by a community of engineers, researchers, and hobbyists who are tired of waiting in queue for cloud APIs.

## Why "Hub"?

Because scattered GitHub repos, Arxiv papers, and Reddit threads aren't enough. We curating the best:
- **Models**: Verified to run on consumer hardware.
- **Knowledge**: Fundamentals explained simply.
- **Code**: Notebooks that actually run.
