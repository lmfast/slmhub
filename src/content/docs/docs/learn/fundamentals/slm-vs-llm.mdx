This notebook helps you benchmark and compare the trade-offs between Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in code. Guide: [SLM vs LLM](/slmhub/docs/learn/fundamentals/slm-vs-llm).

## 1. The Trade-off Matrix
We can visualize the trade-off code.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {
    "Model Type": ["LLM (70B+)", "SLM (7B)", "Micro-SLM (1B)"],
    "VRAM Required (GB)": [48, 6, 2],
    "Inference Speed (tokens/s)": [15, 80, 200],
    "General Reasoning Score": [95, 85, 60],
    "Cost ($/1M Tok)": [5.00, 0.20, 0.05]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
display(df)
```

## 2. When to choose what?

### Choose SLM if:
- You need **low latency** (<100ms)
- You need **privacy** (running locally)
- You have **cost constraints**
- You have a **specific task** (summarization, extraction)

### Choose LLM if:
- You need **broad general knowledge**
- You need complex **multi-step reasoning** (though SLMs are catching up)
- You have **unlimited budget**

## 3. Cost Simulation
Let's calculate the cost difference for a startup serving 1M requests per month.

```python
requests_per_month = 1_000_000
avg_tokens = 500
total_tokens_millions = (requests_per_month * avg_tokens) / 1_000_000

llm_cost = total_tokens_millions * 5.00
slm_cost = total_tokens_millions * 0.20

print(f"Monthly Cost Analysis (1M reqs):")
print(f"LLM API Cost: ${llm_cost:,.2f}")
print(f"SLM Self-Host Cost (Est): ${slm_cost:,.2f}")
print(f"Savings: ${(llm_cost - slm_cost):,.2f} per month")
```
