Let's start from the very beginning and build up to understanding Small Language Models (SLMs). Guide: [What is AI](/slmhub/docs/learn/fundamentals/what-is-ai).

## 1. Machine Learning vs. Traditional Programming
Check how a computer "learns" logic.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Traditional Programming: We write the rule (y = 2x + 1)
def traditional_func(x):
    return 2 * x + 1

# Machine Learning: We give data, it finds the rule
X_train = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y_train = np.array([3, 5, 7, 9, 11]) # The pattern is 2x + 1

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Learned Coefficient (Slope): {model.coef_[0]:.2f} (Expected: 2.0)")
print(f"Learned Intercept: {model.intercept_:.2f} (Expected: 1.0)")
```

## 2. Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
A simple neural network using PyTorch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# A tiny brain
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(1, 10)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layer2(self.relu(self.layer1(x)))

net = SimpleNet()
print(net)
```
