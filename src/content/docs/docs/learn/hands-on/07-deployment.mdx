!pip install torch transformers accelerate -q
```

```python
# Deployment options
deployment_methods = {
    "vLLM": "High-throughput serving (1000+ tokens/sec)",
    "ONNX Runtime": "Mobile/edge deployment",
    "Transformers.js": "Browser deployment with WebGPU",
    "Ollama": "Local deployment",
}

print("Deployment Methods:")
for method, desc in deployment_methods.items():
    print(f"  {method}: {desc}")
```
