# About SLM Hub

## Our Mission

**To democratize AI by making Small Language Models (SLMs) accessible, understandable, and deployable for every developer.**

We believe that the future of AI is not just in massive, centralized models, but in efficient, private, and specialized models running on the edge—on your laptop, your phone, and your own servers.

## Why We Exist

The AI landscape is dominated by discussions about trillion-parameter models. While impressive, they are often:
- **Expensive** to run.
- **Slow** to interact with.
- **Privacy-invasive** (sending data to the cloud).

SLM Hub exists to show the other side: **Small is Beautiful.**

## The Team

SLM Hub is an open-source initiative maintained by the [LMFast](https://github.com/lmfast) community.

### Contribute

We are always looking for contributors! Whether it's fixing a typo, adding a new model guide, or building a new tool.
