## Master SLMs in 2026

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Master the Fundamentals" icon="open-book" class="feature-card card-teal">
    Learn the core concepts of **Small Language Models (SLMs)** - compact AI models that run on your device. Understand **quantization** (making models smaller), **fine-tuning** (customizing for your needs), and **efficient prompting** strategies for models under 10B parameters.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Local Deployment" icon="rocket" class="feature-card card-orange">
    Run powerful AI models **directly on your laptop** or edge devices - no cloud, no API costs, complete privacy. Deploy with **Ollama** (easiest), **vLLM** (fastest), or **WebGPU** (browser-based). Perfect for offline applications and sensitive data.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Model Directory" icon="list-format" class="feature-card card-purple">
    Discover **curated, high-quality SLMs** for every use case - from coding assistants to chatbots. Our auto-updated directory focuses on practical capabilities and real-world applications, not benchmarks. Find the perfect model for your hardware constraints.
