# Gemma (featured)

## When Gemma tends to be a good fit

- Production assistants where you value predictable instruction following.
- Teams that want clean licensing and good ecosystem support (still verify per-model).

## Practical advice

- Use strict formats for downstream integration (JSON schemas).
- Run a small acceptance eval any time you change quantization.
