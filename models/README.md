# Models

## What you’ll find here

- **Featured**: stable, curated pages for a small set of widely used models.
- **Directory**: auto-generated pages synced from Hugging Face metadata for discovery.

## What you won’t find here

We don’t maintain a “best model” leaderboard or benchmark-heavy rankings. The goal is to help you:

- pick a reasonable candidate fast,
- run it locally or serve it,
- validate it on your own workload.

Start with:

- `models/generated/directory.md`
- `tools/model-picker.md`
