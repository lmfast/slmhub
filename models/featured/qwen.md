# Qwen (featured)

## When Qwen tends to be a good fit

- Multilingual applications (verify target languages).
- Long-document analysis when you can constrain outputs.

## Practical advice

- Prefer RAG + constraints over “just increase context”.
- Pin a model revision if you care about reproducibility.
