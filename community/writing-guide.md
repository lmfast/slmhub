# Writing guide

## Page structure (default)

1. **Goal** (one paragraph)
2. **Quickstart** (copy/paste)
3. **How it works** (only what’s needed)
4. **Pitfalls / troubleshooting**
5. **Next steps** (links to adjacent pages)

## Tone

- direct, concrete, and honest
- no marketing language
- use constraints and tradeoffs

## Code blocks

- Keep them short.
- Include enough context to run.
- Avoid pseudo-variables unless you label as “pseudocode”.
