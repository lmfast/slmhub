# Contributing

## Ways to contribute

- Fix typos, broken links, unclear steps.
- Add runnable examples and troubleshooting sections.
- Add a tutorial that ends in a deployable artifact.
- Improve automation (HF sync, link checks, templates).

## Ground rules

- Keep pages **developer-centric** and **minimal**.
- Prefer “how to reproduce” over claims.
- Avoid benchmark-heavy comparisons; focus on **discovery** and **fit**.

## Repo conventions

- **Navigation**: update `SUMMARY.md` when adding a new page.
- **Auto-generated pages** live under `models/generated/`. Don’t edit them by hand.
- **Scripts** live under `scripts/`.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Page has a clear goal and “Quickstart”.
- [ ] Code blocks are runnable (or marked clearly as pseudocode).
- [ ] Links work.
- [ ] Any non-obvious claim has a reference or reproduction steps.
