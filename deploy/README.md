# Deploy

## Quickstart first

If you want the fastest path:

- `deploy/quickstarts/ollama.md` (local)
- `deploy/quickstarts/vllm.md` (server/GPU)

## Then patterns

For real systems, start with:

- `deploy/patterns/hybrid-routing.md` (SLM + LLM fallback)
- `deploy/patterns/rag-enhanced.md` (RAG + SLM)
